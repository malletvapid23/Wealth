            Intro
        </h3>
        <p>
            A funding system that empowers organizations by seeking benefit over profit.
        </p>
        <p>
            To let organizations grow, next to "profit" and "sales" figures, we need to start counting details like, how much they care about the environment, working conditions for their employees or whether they use open source license to share their knowledge.
        </p>

        <h3>
            How it works?
        </h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Define categories for organizations to determine the benefits.
            </li>
            <li>
                Enter ratings for each item in the category.
            </li>
            <li>
                Distribute the fund periodically to all organizations based on their preference in the category and their overall performance. More benefits to society means more income from the pool.
            </li>
        </ol>

            Results (14 Feb. '17)
        </h3>
        <p>
            As an example, we prepared a <a routerLink="/app/survey">demo survey</a> for <strong>License Category</strong>, and asked people to rate each license based on which one would be more helpful on reaching to <a href="https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/sdgs">Development Goals</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Here are the results:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Number of participants: <strong>6</strong></li>
            <li>Apache-2.0: <strong>27,8%</strong></li>
            <li>EULA: <strong>17,4 %</strong></li>
            <li>GPL-3.0: <strong>27,8 %</strong></li>
            <li>MIT: <strong>27,0 %</strong></li>
        </ul>

    <div class="col-md-6">
        <h3>An Extreme Case</h3>
        <p>
            Today, organizations with proprietary license get most of the income.
        </p>
        <p>
            This would be an extreme case but, if software industry would be <u>purely</u> funded through such system by using these results, now open source organizations would have much more income than proprietary ones.
