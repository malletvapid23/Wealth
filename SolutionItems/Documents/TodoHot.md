fix newly added cmrp edit + cancel case!
1. create a temp user and actually save the stuff?
2. use acceptChanges() + if it's a new cmrp, before saving it, change it to 'added'
http://localhost:15001/resourcePool/-2
http://localhost:15001/resourcePool/-2/edit

if this will be okay, no need to retrieve resource pool from server (and remove saved resource pool from cache)

use createEntity in addX cases!

db update!
merge with master!

---
// TODO Most of these functions are related with userService.js - updateX functions
// Try to merge these two - Actually try to handle these actions within the related entity / SH - 27 Nov. '15
function updateCache() {

also review init() method!

UseFixedValue doesn't work at all! fix it!
also check resourcePool.UseFixedResourcePoolRate case!

objects vs entities

add newly created cmrps to fetchedList in cmrpfactory - and don't use newlyCreated flag

resourepool.currentelement - if null, get the main element from elementset

resourcepool - resourcepoolratetotal, count, ratingcount never null
elementfiel - indexratingtotal, count never null
elementcell - numericvaluecount never null - ONLY numericvaluetotal CAN BE NULL? which can be changed to NOT NULL!

rules
directincome type must use fixed value
multiplier cannot use fixed value

in js files, first list items; vm. - scope.
then implementations?

try to use enums + js entities in add functions + tests

move enums to their related class?

copy from an existing cmrp / template?
how to handle user level data - only copy computed ones?

currently saveChanges in datacontext (and in all factory.js) files, saves all changes, not one particular entity?!

check return conflict() blocks, there's something wrong with them!

replace logger with angular.$log?

content for editor? new content or new resourcepool - how to handle the urls?
