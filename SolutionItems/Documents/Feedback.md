1. Rating UI							- Important, bit later
4. Anon user save						- Important, bit later
9. Explain formulas						- Important, bit later - requires new menu items, content structure
10. Total Cost Index confusion?			- Improve presentation, can be merged with 'explain formulas'
6. 2 records rating + income dist		- Improve presentation, can be merged with 'explain formulas'
2. "Total Income" field customization	- Later (maybe with custom formulas)
8. Priority, highly influential?		- Check with other testers
7. all in one income error?				- wealth.api/app_Data - not clear how the error occured?
3. Prio + Knowledge - All in One sync	- OK
5. all users/yours switch				- OK
