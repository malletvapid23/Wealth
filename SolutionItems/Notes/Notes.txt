Using Total Cost Index without other Indexes wouldn't make sense.
If the quality of the product is not known, rewarding low cost wouldn't mean much?
Maybe it's better to start with another index?
New comment: Actually this should be okay, because in the current economic system it's the same.
We don't look quality and other details but just low cost + max. profit. Same ignorance.
