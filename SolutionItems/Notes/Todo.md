# Todo

## Short Term

### Functional

* Prepare resource pool view 
UserResourcePool view recursive selectedElementItem part
* Employee + customer + quality index samples are not there - all in one sample is outdated  
* Work on the chapters again  
* Check userunitofwork + resourcepoolunitofwork + userresourcepoolunitofwork for sample records + delete cases
* Initial (fixed) amount for resource pool
* Currently multiplier + resource pool field types can only be added once per element (or resource pool) - check it again
* ismainelement -> DefaultElement
* instead of MainElement boolean on Element level, can it be done with MainElement field on ResourcePool level? yes, with InverseProperty
* subtotals; sales price, sales price incl. tax, number of sales, total tax, total sales price incl. tax, total income
* userelementcell ratings + counts?
* display index's own ratings + counts?

### Technical

* Unit testing for controllers + unitofwork etc.?
* autofac or ninject or windsor or unity or spring?
check the websites  
http://www.dimecasts.net/Casts/ByTag/Ninject  
unitofwork taking dbcontext as a parameter in the constructor case? passing an initialized context, is it safe at all?  
check asp.net identity as a sample  
* dbcontext -> aanmeldencontext -> resourcepoolmanager?
* generic dbset to resourcepoolrepository?
* remove repositories?
* ElementFields - SortOrder field errors + validations?

* separate web into webclient / webservice
* cors;

http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/dn532203.aspx  
http://www.asp.net/web-api/overview/security/enabling-cross-origin-requests-in-web-api  
* javascript logging; http://jsnlog.com/
* automapper?
* highcharts library loading perf?
* asp.net identity - two factor auth. + account lockout + confirmation + pass reset + security stamp? + social logins + samples
* what happened to appveyor?
* add multiple fields test
* check [required] attribute for newer classes?
* try to convert other batch files to ps scripts as well
* elmah for glimpse?
* dbcontext.create?
* usermanager - owin parts?
* user.issample field? + web.config         <add key="SampleUserId" value="2" />
* db tables -> [x]set?
* public async Task<ClaimsIdentity> GenerateUserIdentityAsync(UserManager <ApplicationUser> manager) - ?
* check validation cases - null is okay but how about Id check - Id > 0?
* use fluent approach on element + item + field + cell
* viewmodels don't belong to business layer?!
* find a better approach for rowversion fix on client-side before saving?
* ignore web - scripts folder?

### Misc

* Update TED link with Evoluo account's version?

## Long Term

### Functional

* default license ratings should be 50/50 and ratings total should always be 100%?
* create sample data with average ratingvalue? or make the rating nullable  
* exclude sample user from rating averages - or make them always 50 / 50?  
* how to calculate average index? some people may enter 1,2,3 - some may enter 100,200,300? always force them to enter percentage?  
or always calculate the total average based on invidiuals percentage? or both?
* in 'not rated index' case, userResourcePool view doesn't show the result
* in'not rated organizations' case, it's collecting the tax but not giving it back? - basically how to treat an organization that doesn't have any rating?

### Technical

* pass entity or entityId - check CopySampleDataAsync() method - sourceUserId vs targetUser?

* When creating resourcepool is gives tons of errors but then does the operation and says ok in UI?!

* breeze - check save + has + get + reject changes  
currently they don't work on entity level? - also prepareBatch method?

* learn how and when to use disposable thingy?  
repo + unitofwork + context + controllers?

* handling concurrency can be improved  
load the new record and let the user choose which one is correct

* check whether unit of work classes need merging  
however, in the current structure, every entity will have a unitofwork + controller by default?  
be careful about different contexts entities - license.resourcepool = sampleResourcePool was creating new resource pools!  
either work with Ids, or try to work on merging unitofwork classes  

* multiple pk cases for user element + user resource pool organization + resource pool organization  
* table structure - by this way, userresourcepool could reach to ratings/values easily;  
User - Resourcepool - UserresourcepoolId  
UserResourcePoolElementCell -> UserResourcePoolId ElementCellId?  

* authorize only for admins didnt work - resourcepool etc.?
any user should be able to access them but only the owners and admins can update them?  
according to this, normal user may not use post action for instance? check these rules later on  

* glimpse on remote server? http://blog.getglimpse.com/2013/12/09/protect-glimpse-axd-with-your-custom-runtime-policy/
* implement soft delete
* exists should work with find or alllive.any() or all.any()?  
* find vs deleted records? - findlive? or don't retrieve dead records at all?
* loading animation? both for breeze + angular  
[nprogress](http://ricostacruz.com/nprogress/) ?
* enum data type didnt work with odata? or api?
* html cache break - angular scripts + views etc.?
* using texbox to update chart data didn't work, it breaks the chart?
* use or try to remove scripts.render() + styles.render() from layout.cshtml - then mvc can be removed completely
* automate .tt scripts with afterbuild?
* try to have a standard for css usage + html layout formats + also js script conventions
* check spelling of the texts!
* enable auto test for appveyor - currently it fails probably because it can't create the db?
* __migrationhistory createdon field error - it seems there is not much to do, it also might be about glimpse?
* upgrade to .net 4.5.1?  
http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh925568%28v=vs.110%29.aspx
* what to do these lines; datacontext.js - batches.push(manager.getEntities(['License'], [breeze.EntityState.Deleted]));
* code contracts?
* Install-Package DynamicQuery?
* http://www.hanselman.com/blog/crossbrowserdebuggingintegratedintovisualstudiowithbrowserstack.aspx
* https://www.runscope.com/signup
* html minifier: https://github.com/deanhume/html-minifier
* Install-Package Microsoft.AspNet.WebApi.HelpPage
* karma js tester?
* web api throttling!
* http://smtp4dev.codeplex.com/
* request validation -> html agility pack?
* web.config httpcompression?
* coded ui test or canopy or ..? web iu testers?
* object level validation IValidatableObject
* http://www.postsharp.net/aspects#examples
* elastic search?
* https://github.com/hazzik/DelegateDecompiler
* Generalizing Validation via Custom Validation Filter Attribute -> general filter for ModelState.IsValid check! http://www.dotnetcurry.com/showarticle.aspx?ID=927
* validateantiforgerytoken + bind attributes in odata controller?
* template pattern for elementfield + fieldtype classes!
* calling saveChanges in dispose of unitofwork?
* extend dbcontext validation errors - check spaanjaars sample and use them in webapp with modelstate blocks?
* result of datetime (ticks) index is bit useless? need reference a start or end date as a reference?

* how about disabling proxy classes? what will be the difference exactly?

* find method  
public IEnumerable[t] FindBy(System.Linq.Expressions.Expression[func[T, bool]] predicate)  
{ IEnumerable[T] query = _dbset.Where(predicate).AsEnumerable();
return query; }

* odata4  
odata4 upgrade was failed; breeze doesn't support it yet!  
http://damienbod.wordpress.com/2014/06/10/getting-started-with-web-api-and-odata-v4/  
http://blogs.msdn.com/b/webdev/archive/2013/11/01/introducing-batch-support-in-web-api-and-web-api-odata.aspx  

* odata - paging (also filters?)  
querayable vs enablequerysupport  
[Queryable(PageSize=10)]  
var queryAttribute = new QueryableAttribute() { AllowedQueryOptions = AllowedQueryOptions.Top | AllowedQueryOptions.Skip, MaxTop = 100 };
config.EnableQuerySupport(queryAttribute);  

* one to one relation;  
{  
[Key, ForeignKey("Player")]  
public long PlayerId { get; set; }  
public virtual Player Player { get; set; }  
}  

* composite key definition;  

[Key]
[Column(Order = 0)]  
public int LocationID { get; set; }  

[Key]
[Column(Order = 1)]  
public int DayID { get; set; }  

[Key]
[Column(Order = 2)]  
public intTimeID { get; set; }  

[Key]  
[Column(Order = 3)]  
public string LanguageID { get; set; }

* sector -> industry?	

* angular interceptor for error handling?
http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/857594/MVC-Thorough-Error-Handling		

* using resourcePool initialValue for Basic Sample is not a good idea - it's not on user level?!

* Content related;
dynamic pricing - low price is good but can't be zero because then it's not sustainable as well?

* resourcepoolfield -> incomefield?
total[x] props -> [x]Multiplied?

* cmrp rate visibility or resourcepool has it?
(total) resource pool field incl. CMRP Add. field visibility?

* try to make stores (repositories), managers and controllers (also business objects) testable?
what are the dependencies? work on separation of concerns.
where to create memorydbcontext? on dbobjects or business objects? also do we need IoC framework? ninject looks quite easy but is it necessary?
instead of dataobjects, it should be dataobjects.EF?

* check todo items

* check error handling again, it was handling api errors as well?

. addfield method should create new elementcells for this new field for the existing items!

. one elementfieldindex per elementfield ?!?!?!

. resourcepoolview - Resource Pool + Field Index combo - should the fields be separate? income part can be at the end?
