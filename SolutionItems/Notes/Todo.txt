. how to handle calculated properties ?!?!
setter could help but only for scalar properties? and check update operation?
how about collections? setter?

resourcepoolorganization - name should be in db + with private or internal or public setter?
userresourcepoolorganization - same
how about userresourcepool - organization collection? or licenseset etc?
actually code first + default odata model builder - collection works perfectly, shows parent class in metadata as complex type and returns it
in wealth, it fails because of edmx? how to define parentplain in edmx (collection of string)

. live - sector - Id byte to smallint

3 ways;
1. update metadata manually - but server side!!!!!!!!!
2. switch to code first, but first solve how to use tt files with code-first context
3. update database structure

manually try to manipulate csdl file! check consoleapp!

check efcontextprovider

custom metadata works, but can it update ?!

even complex type works .. just try to build the app then make it proper!

dont forget to remove parent + colors + testvalue

file nesting vs extension
web essentials?

userresourcepoollist.html was edited manually! zcareful!

---
FINAL SITUATION:
by using manually updated metadata, scalar properties can be exposed
to allow update operation, every scalar property has private set {} part

it works with custom objects - so that's okay - just make it to work and clean the stuff
item.NumberOfSales doesn't work! also formatting is terrible!
continue with other indexes
database is getting inconsistent by the way! zcareful!
