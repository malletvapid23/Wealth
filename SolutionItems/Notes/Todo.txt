merge metadata.xml + edmbuilder output?

namespace is different - dataobjects vs businessobjects
calculated properties are there in dto - how to separate them?
businessobject.tt will be gone?
metadata.tt will be gone ?

											continue with generated + custom businessobjects will be merged?
										automate .tt scripts with afterbuild?
										then asp.net identity? check odata articles first?
