. try to merge unit of work classes - resourcepool unitofwork could create sector + license + organization for instance?
. be careful about different contexts entities - license.resourcepool = sampleResourcePool was creating new resource pools!
either work with Ids, or try to work on merging unitofwork classes
. remove satisfaction word..?
. find vs. deleted records? - findlive? or don't retrieve dead records at all?
. exists should work with find or alllive.any() or all.any() ?
. breeze - check save + has + get + reject changes. currently they don't work on entity level? - also prepareBatch method?
. public vs. private didnt work for now with odata, try it later
. use or try to remove scripts.render() + styles.render() from layout.cshtml - then mvc can be removed completely
. automate .tt scripts with afterbuild?
. sometimes cancel button doesn't allow to go back (fill required?)
.. use history.back sort of method, but first vm needs to be a new object, without createEntity
. learn this disposable thingy? repo + unitofwork + context + controllers?
. implement soft delete
. handling concurrency can be improved - load the new record and let the user choose which one is correct
. html cache break - angular scripts + views etc.?
. try to create initial data from facade, instead of dataobjects layer
. don't allow delete License if it's connected to an Organization (can't be deleted) - same goes for the others but License really can't be deleted
. create sample data with average rating value? or make the rating nullable
. multiple pk for user organization + user sector + user license + user resource pool organization + resource pool organization
. table structure - by this way, userresourcepool could reach to usersectorrating easily?;
user - resourcepool - userresourcepoolId
userresourcepoolsector -> userresourcepoolId sectorId rating
userresourcepoollicense -> userresourcepoolId licenseId rating
userresourcepoolorganization -> userresourcepoolId organizationId rating
. using numbers in sector chart page didn't work, it breaks the chart?
. authorize only for admins didnt work - license, organization, resourcepool, sector
any user should be able to access them. currently definitions link is only visible to admins - according to this, normal user may not use post action for instance? check these rules later on
. update namespaces - osp.wealtheconomy.
. in some delete cases, odatacontroller returns NotFound error? although it's deleted, the record stays on the page until refreshing the page
. how to calculate average index? some people may enter 1,2,3 - some may enter 100,200,300? always force them to enter percentage?
or always calculate the total average based on invidiuals percentage? or both?
. __migrationhistory createdon field error - it seems there is not much to do, it also might be about glimpse?
. updrage to .net 4.5.1? APM doesn't have it right now

. odata - paging (also filters?)
querayable vs enablequerysupport
[Queryable(PageSize=10)]

var queryAttribute = new QueryableAttribute()
{
    AllowedQueryOptions = AllowedQueryOptions.Top | AllowedQueryOptions.Skip,
    MaxTop = 100
};
config.EnableQuerySupport(queryAttribute);

. loading animation? both for breeze + angular

. exclude sample user from rating averages!

. try to add indexes dynamically?

. vs update 2 changes?
