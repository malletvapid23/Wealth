            Fair Share Index: Sharers vs. Keepers
        </h3>
        <p>
            Most of the organizations in the market uses the classic capitalistic approach;
            the business owner makes the initial investment while creating the business and sets the rules in favor of himself, most importantly like getting all the profit.
            This means that even after years of work and significant contributions, most of the employees will not get a share from organization's income
            but get a fixed salary. In the long term, since the organization owners keep getting a bigger pie from the income and not sharing it accordingly,
            this type of income distribution becomes one of the root causes of "Income Inequality".
        </p>
        <p>
            It's important to note that if an organization does otherwise, share the income with its employees in a fair way, in the current system,
            this wouldn't have any financial benefit to that organization. At best, the organization could include this difference in their marketing strategy
            and try to communicate with its consumer about this detail, which may or may not increase their sales number.

            By using <code>Fair Share Index</code>, we can categorize the organizations into "Sharers" vs. "Keepers".
            Again we can decide which side is more important by rating the options, then the organizations will get an income from the pool based on their approach.
