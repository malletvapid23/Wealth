            Fair Share Index - Income Inequality Part II: Sharers vs. Keepers
        </h3>
        <p>
            Most of the organizations in the market uses a classic approach;
            the business owner makes the initial investment while creating the business and sets the rules in favor of himself, most importantly this lets him to get all the profit.
            Meaning that even after years of work and significant contributions, most of the employees will not get a share from organization's income
            but get a fixed salary. In the long term, since the organization owners keep getting a bigger pie from the income and not sharing it accordingly,
            this type of income distribution becomes another root cause of "Income Inequality".
        </p>
        <p>
            If organizations could try to measure all types of contributions, including the owner's, then share the income based on this result,
            it would have a significant difference for the society, the difference between the organization owners and the workers would be much more small.
        </p>
        <p>
            Although giving shares to employees is not something new, it is used in a nonstandard way and by limited organizations.
            On the contrary, it could be used in a much wider sense and be encouraged in a systematic way.
            <!--There are already many organizations that give some share to their employees, especially startups,
            in order to motivate them. However, it's still very limited and this approach could be used in a much wider sense and be encouraged in a systematic way.-->
            <!--It's important to note that if an organization tries this approach, share the income with its employees in a fair way, in the current system,
            this wouldn't have any financial benefit to that organization. At best, the organization could try to communicate with its consumer about this detail,
            which may or may not increase their sales number.-->
        </p>
        <p>
            <!--By using <code>Fair Share Index</code>, we can categorize the organizations into "Sharers" vs. "Keepers".-->
            By using <code>Fair Share Index</code>, we can categorize the organizations by their approach of how they distribute their income,
            whether they ignore and count the various contributions from their workers.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the following sample, we will use two categories under Fair Share;
            <ul>
                <li>Keepers: Uses the classic approach; the owner gets all the profit, workers get fixed salary, regardless of the significance of the workers' contributions.</li>
                <li>Sharers: Measures all of sorts of positive and negative contributions and distributes the income based on the outcome.
            </ul>
            Again it's up to us to decide and rate which option fits to society in order to have a better income distribution.
            Then the organizations will get an income from the pool based on their approach.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                By using <code>+</code> button increase <code>Number of Sales</code>, initially all organizations will have same <code>Total Income</code>.
            </li>
            <li>
                Click on <code>Fair Share</code> link below and rate both items based on their importance.
            </li>
            <li>
                By using breadcrumb links, you can navigate back to initial <code>Organization</code> view to see the difference in <code>Total Income</code>.
            </li>
            <li>
                Toggle <code>Display</code> between <code>Only My Ratings</code> and <code>All Ratings</code> to see only your ratings or the average of all users'.
            </li>
        </ul>

            Developing a standard of measuring the contributions is not in the scope of this project.
            Obviously it is not an easy task and would require many discussions from both owners and workers side.
            Certain questions need to be addressed;
            <ul>
                <li>What will be the advantages of being the owner and taking the initialize?</li>
                <li>Even if the organization doesn't have enough income, workers would like to get paid for their service.
                What would be the benefit of taking a risk and investing in the organization in the long term?</li>
                <li>Should the negative contributions be counted and how much they should affect the income?</li>
                <li>When an organization declares that it shares the income based on contributions, how this could actually be ensured?</li>
            </ul>
            Without answering these questions and having a standard, <code>Fair Share Index</code> might be the least practical index in this system.
            However we believe it can still be a good sample on how we could approach to "Income Inequality" issue.
