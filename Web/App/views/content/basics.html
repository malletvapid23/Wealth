                In the following sample, there are four organizations that are equal to each other in every aspect, except they use different strategies to motivate their employees.
                In <strong>Existing Model</strong>, since this difference is ignored, each organization will have the same <strong>Total Income</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>New Model</strong> introduces <strong>Employee Satisfaction Index</strong>.
                By using this index, we can enter which organization's employees satisfied with their organization's strategy
                and based on this new data, organizations' Total Income will now differ.
            </p>

                    Since <strong>New Model</strong> uses <strong>CMRP</strong>, and requires an amount to be distributed.
                    This amount will automatically be calculated and it's 10% of the total spendings in the system.
                    This approach will be used throughout the samples and the details will be explained in further chapters.

            <ul>
                <li>
                    In Existing Model, increase organizations' <strong>Number of Sales</strong> by clicking <code>+</code> button.<br />
                    This will increase Number of Sales of all organizations in both models to let you compare the results easily.
                </li>
                <li>
                    In New Model, update <strong>Employee Satisfaction</strong> rating of the organizations by using <code>+</code> and <code>-</code> buttons next to them.<br />
                    See the difference in Total Income fields in both models.

                    <strong>CMRP Rate / Amount:</strong>
                    Since New Model uses <strong>CMRP</strong>, it requires an amount to be distributed.<br />
                    This amount will automatically be calculated based on <strong>CMRP Rate</strong> which is 10% of the total spendings in the system.<br />
                    When you change the values of Number of Sales, <strong>CMRP Amount</strong> will be changed accordingly.<br />
                    This approach will be used throughout the samples and the details will be explained in further chapters.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Number of Ratings:</strong>
                    In New Model, there is a toggle switch next to its title.<br />
                    The number shows how many users already entered their ratings for this CMRP.<br />
                    Toggle the switch to see only your ratings or the average of all users.

                If we could rate 'Employee Satisfaction' of the organizations in real life, we could reward the ones with a higher rating as in this sample.
                Adding indexes to the system sets additional priorities for the organizations, instead of just focusing to profit.

                Although only four <!-- TODO four or three or five? update this number at the end --> different indexes will be presented in the following chapters,
                as long as they are measurable, more indexes can be added into the system.
                <!--Indexes can have static values or they be rated by the users.-->
