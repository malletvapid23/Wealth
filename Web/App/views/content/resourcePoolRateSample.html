                CMRP Amount: The Fountain
            </h3>
            <p>
                <code>CMRP Rate</code> determines the size of the pool, if it gets bigger, the amount that we can control through the pool gets bigger as well.
                In the previous samples, in order to make the difference apparent, this number was fixed to 10% of the total spendings in the system.
            </p>
            <p>
                At this stage, the application will be used as a simulation tool; we will be creating samples with various cases to show how we could improve the system
                and allow you to create your own. So, we can easily experiment with the size of the pool as well.
            </p>
            <p>
                <!--In reality, In order to make an actual change, there has to be an amount in our pools and allocate them based on the outcome.-->
                After gathering enough data, if the results convince us that a certain pool can make a difference, then the next phase will be to actually creating the pool.
                How these resource pools and amounts will be realized may vary. Initially, certain amount can be collected from the volunteers.
                In the long run, if the number of convinced people will be getting higher in a certain country and there is a political power,
                to make it much more systematic, it would be ideal to implement such system into the tax system of that country.
            </p>
            <p>
                In any case, even if the amount that will be distributed through this system would be very small, publicly affecting the market,
                rewarding the beneficial organizations, would have an important, positive effect to the society.
                <!--making a resource distribution by our collective decision would be an important experience and give a message to the organizations.-->
            </p>
            <!--<p>
                <code>CMRP Rate</code> determines the size of the pool, if it gets bigger, the amount that we can control through the pool gets bigger as well.
                In the previous samples, this number was fixed and it was 10% of the total spendings in the system.
                However, like other variables in the system, this rate can also be decided collectively.

                To be able to make a difference in the system, we're allocating the money that has been in the pool.
                In the previous samples, this amount was always fixed and it was 50% higher than <code>Total Sales Price</code>.
                In reality, this money has to come from somewhere.
            </p>
            <p>
                Ideal way of creating a <code>Resource Pool</code> would be to collect some portion of the money from every transaction,
                like value added tax. However, as seen already, with two important exceptions;
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        We the people will control how this pool will be distributed
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Every organization in the system can get a share from this pie based on their performance
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </p>
            <p>
                As like other parameters of the system, this rate could also be decided collectively.
            </p>-->
