                <!--The World is becoming an interesting place to experiment.-->
                Today we see a lot of progress around the World. Our technologies are advancing at an accelareted rate.
                Allowing us to communicate instantly, get quickly organized, make collective decisions and now even make crowd investments.
                <!--The communication systems are getting better, allowing us to quickly get organized, make collective decisions and even make crowd investments.-->
                As communities, our capabilities are getting better at solving problems.
                On the other side, we still have big challenges like economic crises, destruction of the environment, income inequality and so on.
                It's a good time to question existing systems, improve them by the new possibilities and try to deal with these global issues.

                Economic system is responsible for allocating the resources to the organizations, most commonly via the transactions between the organizations and the consumers.
                To get more resources, an organization has to;
                <ul>
                    <li>Maximize the price, therefore the profit</li>
                    <li>Increase the number of sales</li>
                </ul>
                <!--For an organization, the formula to get more resources is simple; lower the costs, increase the sales price and multiply the result with the number of sales.-->
                However, organizations have also other features that can be measured and equally important for the society;
                like responsibilities towards its workers, being environment friendly or even producing healthy products.

            <p>
                In following the sample, there are two organizations that are equal to each other in every aspect, except they use different strategies to motivate their employees.
                In <code>Existing Model</code>, since it ignores this difference, each organization will have the same <code>Total Income</code>.
                <code>New Model</code> will introduce <code>Employee Satisfaction</code> index.
                By using this index, we can enter which organization's employees satisfied with their organization's strategy
                and based on this new data, organizations' <code>Total Income</code> will now differ.
            </p>
            <!--<p class="bg-info">

            <div class="bs-callout bs-callout-info">
                <h4>Difference between the models</h4>
                <p>
                    In <code>New Model</code>, <code>Total Income</code> is 15 percent higher than <code>Existing Model</code>.
                    This difference will be explained in further chapters.

            <ul>
                <li>
                    In <code>Existing Model</code>, increase organizations' <code>Sales Number</code> by clicking <code>+</code> button.<br />
                    This will increase <code>Sales Number</code> in both models to be able compare the results easily.
                </li>
                <li>
                    In <code>New Model</code>, update <code>Employee Satisfaction</code> rating of the organizations by using <code>+10</code> and <code>-10</code> buttons and see the difference in <code>Total Income</code> fields in both models.

                If we could measure <code>Employee Satisfaction</code> of the organizations in real life, we could reward the ones with a higher rating as in this sample.
                Adding indexes to the system sets additional priorities for the organizations, instead of just focusing to profit.
                Although only 4 different indexes will be presented in the following chapters,
                as long as they can be measured in a correct way, more indexes can be added into the system.
                <!--Indexes can have static values or they be rated by the users.-->

                One of the issues in the current system is that the consumers most only interact with the organizations about their <!--regular /--> daily needs.
            </p>
            <p>
                For example, the consumer could think that education sector is more important for the society than most of the other sectors.
                However, if she is not a student or a parent of a student, she has no direct relation with this sector, therefore cannot support it in a systematic way.
                Instead, she could spend her resources on clothing, cosmetics, entertainment and so on, that might have a less priority.

                    ... and so this leads to the paradox that because the disease (malaria) is only in the poorer countries, it doesn't get much investment.
                    For example, there's more money put into baldness drugs than are put into malaria. Now, baldness, it's a terrible thing.
                    And rich men are afflicted. And so that's why that priority has been set.
