                <!--The World is becoming an interesting place to experiment.-->
                Today we see a lot of progress around the World. Our technologies are advancing at an accelareted rate.
                Allowing us to communicate instantly, get quickly organized, make collective decisions and now even make crowd investments.
                <!--The communication systems are getting better, allowing us to quickly get organized, make collective decisions and even make crowd investments.-->
                As communities, our capabilities are getting better at solving problems.
                On the other side, we still have big challenges like economic crises, destruction of the environment, income inequality and so on.
                It's a good time to question existing systems, improve them by the new possibilities and try to deal with these global issues.

                Economic system is responsible for allocating the resources to the organizations, most commonly via the transactions between the organizations and the consumers.
                To get more resources, an organization has to;
                <ul>
                    <li>Maximize the price, therefore the profit</li>
                    <li>Increase the number of sales</li>
                </ul>
                <!--For an organization, the formula to get more resources is simple; lower the costs, increase the sales price and multiply the result with the number of sales.-->
                However, organizations have also other features that can be measured and equally important for the society;
                like responsibilities towards its workers, being environment friendly or even producing healthy products.

            <p>
                In following the sample, there are two organizations that are equal to each other in every aspect, except they use different strategies to motivate their employees.
                In <code>Existing Model</code>, since this difference is ignored, each organization will have the same <code>Total Income</code>.
            </p>
            <p>
                <code>New Model</code> will introduce <code>Employee Satisfaction</code> index.
                By using this index, we can enter which organization's employees satisfied with their organization's motivation strategy
                and based on this new data, organizations' <code>Total Income</code> will now differ.
            </p>

                <h4>Difference between the models</h4>
                <p>
                    In <code>New Model</code>, <code>Total Income</code> is 50 percent higher than <code>Existing Model</code>.
                    This difference will be explained in further chapters.

                    This will increase <code>Sales Number</code> in both models to be able compare the results easily.
                </li>
                <li>
                    In <code>New Model</code>, update <code>Employee Satisfaction</code> rating of the organizations by using <code>+10</code> and <code>-10</code> buttons and see the difference in <code>Total Income</code> fields in both models.

                If we could measure <code>Employee Satisfaction</code> of the organizations in real life, we could reward the ones with a higher rating as in this sample.
                Adding indexes to the system sets additional priorities for the organizations, instead of just focusing to profit.

            <p>
                Although only 4 different indexes will be presented in the following chapters,
                as long as they are measurable, more indexes can be added into the system.

                One of the issues in the current system is that the consumers mostly only interact with the organizations about their <!--regular /--> daily needs.
            </p>
            <p>
                <!-- Review this paragraph -->
                For example, one might think that education sector is more important for the society than most of the other sectors.
                However, to be able to interact and spend money within this sector, one should either be a student or a relative of a student.
                Otherwise, even though it is still important, it would be out of the routine and cannot be supported in a regular basis.
                <!--However, if she is not a student or a parent of a student, she has no direct relation with this sector, therefore cannot support it in a systematic way.-->
                Instead, one could spend her <!--her?--> income on clothing, cosmetics, entertainment and so on, that might actually have a less priority.
            </p>
            <!-- Citation needed -->
            <!--<p>
                This is one of the reasons why education system is explicitly supported by the states in even if the country is using Free Market economy.

                <code>Sector Index</code> could gives us the opportunity to see the overall of the system and let us distribute the resources to the sectors by comparing them.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the next part, you will see 6 important sectors.
                Every organization under these sectors is trying to solve one of the issues that the society has.
                One is developing video games to entertain, another is trying to educate, one is trying to cure cancer, another is trying to make you look good.
                <!--What we should keep in mind, if the society is more healthier,-->
                We believe, when we could directly choose which sectors have more priority and could affect how to distribute the resources,
                the result would be very different than the current one.

                    For example, there's more money put into baldness drugs than are put into malaria. Now, baldness, it's a terrible thing.
                    And rich men are afflicted. And so that's why that priority has been set.

                While creating new products and services, organizations also produce the <mark>knowledge</mark> of how these products, services could be created.

            <p>
                Although this is a very unique and important asset to the society, majority of the organizations tend to keep this knowledge to themselves by using restricted licenses, patents.
                <!--This due to the fact that sharing the knowledge doesn't provide any benefit to them and they don't want to risk their investment.-->
                <!--</p>

                In the long term, this 'overprotection' turns out to be a very counter-productive approach, reduces the collabration chance between the organizations.
                When the knowledge was not shared, every other organization has to spend a similar time and energy to get to the same level.
                In other words, we keep reinventing the same knowledge over and over again.

                <code>Knowledge Index</code> allows us to compare the licenses side by side and rate them directly.

                In the next part, you will see two sample licenses that represent the existing situation in general.
                Open source licenses usually give much more right to the users of its product and
                restricted licenses, mostly used for propritary products, would only allow to the product to be used by its owner.
            </p>
            <p>
                On the contrary to this situation, in reality, from income perspective, restricted licenses dominate their market.
                In other words, we reward the organizations that use restricted licenses.
