                <!--The world is becoming an interesting place to experiment.-->
                Today we see a lot of progress around the world. Our technologies are advancing at an accelareted rate.
                Allowing us to communicate instantly, get quickly organized, make collective decisions and now even make crowd investments.
                <!--The communication systems are getting better, allowing us to quickly get organized, make collective decisions and even make crowd investments.-->
                As communities, our capabilities are getting better at solving problems.
                On the other side, we still have big challenges like economic crises, destruction of the environment, income inequality and so on.
                It's a good time to question existing systems, improve them by the new possibilities and try to deal with these global issues.

                <!--Today we are facing many major issues due to how the economic system works, more specifically how we distribute our resources.-->
                One area that can <!--heavily -->be questioned is how the economic system works and how we distribute our resources.

                <!--Economic system is responsible for allocating the resources to the organizations, ideally with the most benefits to the society.-->
                Economic system is responsible for allocating the resources to the organizations, most commonly via the transactions between the organizations and the consumers.
                To get more resources, an organization has to;
                <ul>
                    <li>Maximize the price, therefore the profit</li>
                    <li>Increase the number of sales</li>
                </ul>
                <!--For an organization, the formula to get more resources is simple; lower the costs, increase the sales price and multiply the result with the number of sales.-->
                However, organizations have also other features that can be measured and equally important for the society;
                like responsibilities towards its workers, being environment friendly or even producing healthy products.

                Wealth Economy is an attempt to create a collaborative, customizable system to allow the society manage its resources.
                It aims to improve the system by the following steps;
                <ul>
                    <li>Creates <code>Crowd Managed Resource Pool (CMRP)</code> that holds certain amount to be distributed</li>
                    <li>Define various <code>Indexes</code> for the organizations which are new parameters, categories that seek benefit to the society</li>
