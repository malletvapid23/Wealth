                Although 'Quality' subject has lot of measurable parameters under it, none of them has a direct impact on the income of the organizations.
                If the organization has a better quality product, this might increase their sales, therefore they can have more resources. However, the connection between high quality - more resources is not that tight.

                Quality Index allows us the rate quality of the products / services as a separate parameter in the system and distributes the resources based on the outcome.
