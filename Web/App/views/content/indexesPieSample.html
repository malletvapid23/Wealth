        <p>
            In the previous samples, there was one index per CMRP.
            However in most cases, there will be mixture of indexes to determine which organization is more beneficial to the society.
            Since not every index is equally important, their share within the pool also need to be set.
        </p>
        <p>
            <code>Indexes</code> view allows us to compare and rate each index within the pool.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the following sample, we will see one organization with previously mentioned indexes.
            Here is a quick summary of the indexes:
            <ul>
                <li>Sector Index: What type of issues that the organization is trying to solve, how fundamental they are?</li>
                <li>Knowledge Index: Is the organization sharing its knowledge with the society or keeping it to itself?</li>
                <li>Total Cost Index: What is the cost of the organization to the society?</li>
                <li>Fair Share Index: Does the organization share its income with its workers by measuring each member's contribution?</li>
            </ul>
            Please rate these indexes based on their importance and set how much an index should control the amount in the pool.
