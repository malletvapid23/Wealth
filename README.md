### WebApi Deployment

You can deploy WebApi appliation through Visual Studio publish.  

Only remark is, configuration files are excluded from deploy (Build Action: 'None').  
When deploying the project, update following configuration files with your own settings and manually copy them:
* WebApi\googleanalytics.js
* WebApi\Web.config
* WebApi\Configs\\*.config

If you would like to make the application offline during the deployment, you can use **app_offline.htm_**.

### AngularClient Deployment

AngularClient is a Angular CLI project and all of its commands are available.

Thera are three environments defined in `.angular-cli.json` file: `dev`, `test` & `prod`.  
For `test` & `prod`, please create your own files by copying `dev` configuration file:

    AngularClient\src\app-settings\environments\environment-settings.ts

To prepare a production bundle, run the following on your command console:

    ng build -prod

For more options, please visit [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli)
