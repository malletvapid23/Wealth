#### Setup

* Download the copy of the project
* Open it Visual Studio
* Build it
* Update the files under Web\Configs folder with your own settings
* Run the Web project
* Navigate to http://localhost:15001/ with your browser

Important: There are still projects & files that have some static configuration, i.e. test projects and tt files.
Making them user / environment ignorant is in our wish list, however it's not high priority at the moment.
Let us know in case it becomes an important issue for you.
