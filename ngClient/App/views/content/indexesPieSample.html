                Indexes Pie

            <p>
                In the previous samples, there was one index per CMRP.
                However in most cases, there will be mixture of indexes to determine which organization is more beneficial to the society.
                Since not every index is equally important, their share within the pool also need to be set.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Indexes</strong> view allows us to compare and rate each index within the pool.
