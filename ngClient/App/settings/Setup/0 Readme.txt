The files under this folder are the initial configuration files.
They will be copied to the parent folder (configs) on the first build of the application.
Modify the copies under "Configs" folder (not the ones under "Setup") with your own settings.
To allow users to have different settings, files under "Configs" folder will not be stored in the source control.
